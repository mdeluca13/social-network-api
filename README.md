## Description

The Social Network API is program that allows the user to GET, POST, PUT and DELETE the Social Network Users and Thoughts. It also allows you to POST and DELETE Reactions to thoughts and Friendships between users. This program uses Node.js, NoSQL, as well as NPM packages like date-fns, express, and mongoose. 

I was able to demonstrate what I have learned throughout the Carleton University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp as well as use my researching skills to find and complete this program.

## Installation

You will need to install [node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download). 

You will also have to install through the package.json file: 

- [date-fns](https://www.npmjs.com/package/date-fns)
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
- [mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

This can be done through npm install in your Node.JS Terminal.

You will also need access to [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the API routes. 

## Usage

1. Run node index.js in the Terminal for the index.js file to start the server
2. In Insomnia, you can then run GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE on the different routes using http://localhost:3001/.
